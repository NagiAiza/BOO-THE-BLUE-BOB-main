## üìú About The Game
**Boo The Blue Bob** is an ambitious 2D adventure that blends multiple gameplay styles. Players will begin in a top-down world, exploring areas, collecting items, and interacting with a cast of characters like a mysterious sorcerer and a cynical thief. The game features a complete dialogue system with animated text, driving a story with simple quests. After proving your worth by collecting enough gems, you will unlock challenging side-scrolling platformer levels where your reflexes and combat skills will be put to the test.

## üìñ Gameplay Overview

The adventure unfolds across different interconnected scenes:

1. Explore the World: You begin in a top-down scene like SceneVille. You control Boo using 4-directional movement to explore the map.
2. Talk to Characters: You will encounter characters like the Sorcerer and the Thief. By entering their area, you can initiate conversations managed by the dialogue system.
3. Solve Quests: Progress by completing tasks. For example, interacting with the Thief can set a voleur_taken flag, which allows the Thief to follow you and lets you open a locked door.
4. Collect Items: Search the exploration maps to find and collect gems.
5. Unlock New Levels: Once you have collected at least 3 gems, you can access the entrance to the side-scrolling combat level.
6. Conquer the Platformer: In the combat level, the gameplay shifts. You must navigate the level, avoid traps, collect 3 coins, and manage your health to win.
